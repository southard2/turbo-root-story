Jeff is a chef. Jeff lives in Australia. Jeff's house is right next to a swarm of kangaroos. Jeff hates kangaroos.
When Jeff was younger, he used to love kangaroos. However, one time his brother was run into by a kangaroo and injured, so now Jeff is afraid of them!
Once, during a cold winter, the kangaroos broke into Jeff's house to keep warm. Jeff was chased out of his home by the kangaroos. Since then, the kangaroos live a warm and happy life.
